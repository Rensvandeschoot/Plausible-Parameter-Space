# Plausible Parameter Space (PPS) Shiny App

## :star: Purpose The Plausible Parameter Space (PPS) Shiny App is designed to
help users define their priors in a linear regression with two regression
coefficients. Users are asked to specify their plausible parameter space and
their expected prior means and uncertainty around these means. The PhD-delay
data ([Van de Schoot et al.,
2013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0068839)) is used an easy-to-go
introduction to Bayesian inference. In this example the linear and quadratic
effect of age on PhD-delay are estimated. Users learn about the interaction
between a linear and a quadratic effect in the same model, about how to think
about plausible parameter spaces, and about specification of normally
distributed priors for regression coefficients.

## :gem: How can you profit from it? First of all, this app might be a useful
tool for your teaching if you would like to familiarize your students with the
basic logic of Bayesian inference. Second, feel free to use this material as a
template for your own app. 


## Installation

Download the files, open R-studio, install the R-packages, and run the app.

The Shiny app also runs at a server of [Utrecht University](https://www.rensvandeschoot.com/tutorials/pps-app/). 

## Usage

The app is self-explanatory. Users can just follow the 4 steps listed in the
left side bar and answer the various questions asked.
